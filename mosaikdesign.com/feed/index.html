It was a fun project that involved completely redesigning the kitchen with an updated layout, flow, and look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our clients are so happy with the result and are now able to enjoy a completely upgraded kitchen that feels and looks like the rest of their home. Although the client is the only person we aim to impress with our work, this project has also earned larger recognition and was recently featured in Oregon Home magazine!</span></p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You buy a home that you love. Then, over the years, things change, and your home is no longer as well suited to your needs. Maybe youâre starting a family, your parents or in-laws are moving in, or youâre working from home for the foreseeable future.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But outgrowing your home doesnât mean you need to move out of a house and neighborhood you love! Instead, a home remodel or addition could be the perfect solution.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this post, weâll take a look at common remodels for different life events and some of the features you might want to consider.</span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot more of us are working from home these days. Whether youâre repurposing your guest room, carving out space in a large closet, or </span><a href="https://mosaikdesign.com/our-services/portland-home-addition-remodel/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adding on</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an extra room to your home, having a designated work space helps separate work from home life and keeps you focused.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few tips for creating a great workspace in your home:Â </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choose a good location</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideally, your office would be distraction-free, private, and have a window to let in some natural light. If you have children in your home, you might want to consider a space where you can close your door during meetings. And if you have spaces in your home you donât use very often, like a guest room or a formal dining room, consider repurposing those spaces into a great workspace for yourself. A </span><a href="https://mosaikdesign.com/our-services/portland-basement-remodel/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">refinished basement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can also be a perfect place to make space for a home office!Â </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you create a comfortable space that meets your needs</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is your desk big enough to accommodate your work style? Do you have storage options? How many monitors work best for you? Is your desk chair comfortable and supportive? Do you have proper lighting?Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are all good questions to ask when creating your work from home office space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Â </span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you set up your space, plan for electrical outlets, wifi, etc.Â </span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last thing you want is a bundle of cords cluttering up your floorspace, or to get set up only to realize you canât connect to the internet! Make a checklist of the items you know youâll need for your workspace before you begin â this way, youâll know what to prepare and save yourself time and frustration down the road.Â </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make it your own!Â </span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Especially if youâre working with limited space, itâs a good idea to keep clutter and decorations to a minimum. Instead, add little elements of decor and color that fit with your personal style and help breathe a little life into your new space. Not only will this help you stay more focused, but youâll enjoy working there more, too.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When in doubt, donât be afraid to ask the experts! </span><a href="https://mosaikdesign.com/contact/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contact us</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> today to learn how our team can help!Â </span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether youâre preparing for your first child or welcoming another into your family, there are a few common rooms to remodel that can improve the functionality of your home.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Kitchen</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kitchen is the </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/discoverpersonalloans/2018/05/14/americas-most-popular-home-remodeling-projects-and-what-theyll-cost-you/#3590ef211d59" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most popular room</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a house to remodel, and remodeling it with children in mind can be especially useful down the line. You and your family are likely to spend a lot of time in the kitchen, so making sure the space is set up with durable, long-lasting materials and designed to meet your needs is key.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few common components of a </span><a href="https://mosaikdesign.com/our-services/portland-kitchen-remodel/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">kitchen remodel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with kids in mind:Â </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knocking out dividing walls between kitchen and dining room: Especially if you have a newborn, being able to see them in their high chair in the dining room while you are in the kitchen is always helpful.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting up booth seating or an island for convenient seating options: Not only are booths extra fun for kids, so are stools! Create a fun place for your kids to hang out and gather where you eat.Â </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering solid surface or granite countertops for children: We know the permanent markers are going to come out eventually, right? Solid surface countertops are a great option for children because they are non-porous, durable, and easy to clean. Plus, they come in a wide variety of colors and styles. Granite countertops, when properly sealed, are also very easy to clean and heat and stain resistant.Â </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Kids bedroomÂ </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you are simply preparing another bedroom in your home for your new child, or adding on a bedroom, here are some things to consider:Â </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a kid friendly space. That means thinking from a little kidâs perspective and choosing furniture, decorations, and play items relevant to their age and (importantly!) height.Â </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add cubbies or other storage space so your kid(s) can learn to put their toys away.Â </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plan for the future â if youâre working with a small bedroom, consider a loft bed when your child is old enough. Or if you know youâll need to have one bedroom work for two kids, make sure you have enough space for a bunk bed.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Entryway or mudroom</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite how common our rainy seasons here in the Pacifc Northwest, many Portland area homes were built without an entryway or mudroom to take off wet, dirty shoes, or hang up coats and bags. Instead, they usually open up right into the living room.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This of course can (and does!) work fine for many Portland area residents, but the addition of children can be an added challenge to keeping your front door area clean. Simply adjusting your space to create an entryway, repurposing a laundry room with a backdoor, or moving forward with a small addition can help solve this problem.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever you decide, here are a few key features to make your entryway/mudroom as useful as possible:</p>
<p></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coat rack or closet â ideally with hooks or a rack at a height where your kid(s) can hang their own coat</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shoe storageÂ </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seating area to take off or put on shoesÂ </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designated place to store keys or hang your purseÂ </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pro tip: carve out a space to store your reusable grocery bags so they are always within reach as you head out the doorÂ </span></li>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many reasons we might invite our parents to live with us as they head into their golden years, but not all homes are up for the task. Luckily, there are some easy things you can add or create in your home for a functional and private in-law suite.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But first, what is an in-law suite? In general, itâs a private living space within a home. It often features a bedroom and a bathroom with its own private door, but can feature a kitchenette and much more!Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few things to consider when planning a remodel for an in-law suite:</p>
<p></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bedroom and bathroom of an in-law suite would ideally be located on the first floor â if not, planning for a chair lift or elevator is a good idea.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider updating or adding accessibility features like widening the doorways, updating the bathroom to a zero-transition shower, or installing easy to reach storage in the bedroom and bathroom.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure both you and your parents have private space â you probably havenât lived together in awhile and this will help make the transition as easy as possible!Â </span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now matter what project youâre considering, youâre probably also wondering if now is the best time to start a project like this. Your home should of course meet your needs, but you want to keep your family safe during the COVID-19 pandemic, too.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thankfully, it doesnât have to be either/or. There are many precautions you can take (and that you should expect from your design-build partner). In todayâs post, learn how to keep you and your family safe at home while renovating or remodeling during COVID-19.</span></p></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, youâre probably feeling like a pro at FaceTime, Zoom, or other video conferencing options. The good news is, many contractors and remodeling companies are too! To keep social contact outside of your household to a minimum, request that any design consultations, quotes, or other initial meetings be done via video conference. Just make sure to have the following ready beforehand:Â </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your goals, needs, and priorities for your homeÂ </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A rough idea of your budget</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Photos of the areas youâd like to remodel</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or simply ask your design and build company what information would help them get a good idea of your space. Thatâs one unnecessary visit to your household saved!Â  </span></p></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you move forward with a remodel, itâs important to have a conversation with your design and build team detailing how they plan to keep you, your family, and their team safe. Consider asking them the following:Â </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are you doing to monitor the health of your employees?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What precautions will you have in place when working in my home?Â Â </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does your company have a written COVID-19 plan in place that covers how work will safely be done in my home?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who is the supervisor responsible for ensuring your workers follow this plan?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it possible to designate one entry point to the worksite?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Itâs worth reviewing any other concerns you may have with them so you can work out a plan to make you feel comfortable while theyâre working in your home.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also make a plan for yourself and how you and your family will stay COVID safe while the work is being done. Does it include leaving hand sanitizer at all entry points? Avoiding certain rooms throughout the day? Scheduling time to do a quick disinfect of all door knobs throughout the day? Make a plan that works best for you and leaves you feeling safe and comfortable.Â </span></p></div>

Currently, that means:Â </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wear a mask at all times when around people outside your household</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Practice social distancing by staying at least 6 feet apart from people outside your household</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wash hands frequently with soap and water, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if soap is unavailable</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disinfect high-touch surfaces regularly (door knobs, sink faucets, cell phones, etc.)Â </span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With most of us working from home these days, itâs more important than ever that your home is a relaxing and productive environment. With your newly remodeled space, soon it will be! In the meantime, we suggest working closely with your remodeling firm to decide when you should stay home and when might be a good time to take a break.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When possible, we recommend trying to get out of the house during the most disruptive processes. Your project manager will help you know when that might be and what to expect ahead of time. Depending on the size and scope of your project, this might mean finding a safe place to work for the day or even </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/are-airbnbs-safe-coronavirus#how-is-airbnb-enforcing-cleaning-policies?" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">renting </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">an Airbnb or finding other lodging while the work is being done.Â </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I knew from a very young age! Growing up in Michigan, there was this octagon house we used to visit. It totally fascinated me and I wanted to go back all the time â that was my first clue.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iâm creative and so interior design and construction became my natural creative outlet. I used to rearrange furniture at home all the time. And then when I bought my first home, it became my own personal remodeling project. The rest is history!</span></p></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I had to choose 3 words to describe my personal style, it would be classic, friendly, and professional. I think this style is reflected in my professional work as well. I help my clients avoid being too trendy,Â  infusing more of my clean and classic approach to get the best results.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than just changes in style trends, thereâs been a transition in how people view the design and remodeling process. With the advent of HGTV, Instagram, and YouTube, DIY design is encouraged and celebrated more than ever â especially among Millenials.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homeowners today are much more informed than they were even 10 years ago. Many of my clients have detailed information about products available and where to get them. These changes have turned the home remodel and design process into a really collaborative project between designer and client, and I think thatâs great.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead at future trends and changes in the industry, I believe smart home technology will continue to evolve and be a very big part of interior design going forward. As a designer, itâs really important to stay up-to-date on this new home technology to recommend and incorporate the best products.</span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><h3><b>Tell us about your approach. What sets you apart from other designers?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collaboration is everything. This is very apparent in the approach we take at Mosaik and I really believe it makes all the difference.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I canât tell you how many times Iâve talked with people who have worked with a different designer and experienced budget overruns, scheduling conflicts, no-show contractors, and lengthy delays. Thatâs exactly what we </span><b>donât </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As one of the few true âDesign-Buildâ firms in Oregon with Designer and Builder as owners, we are highly invested in every aspect of every project. The approach I take at Mosaik is based on building a relationship and never pointing fingers. We work together with the entire team, including the client, to create plans, solve problems, and make each project something special. </span></p></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First things first, I always recommend that people interview at least 3 firms and </span><b>always </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">check referrals and reviews.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you interview them and evaluate a company, ask yourself a few questions:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do I feel comfortable having these individuals in my home for 3-6 months?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do I trust them?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is their design style similar to mine?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What level of communication and customer service do they provide?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do they have a track record of finishing on time?</span></li>

One of my favorite features is the custom Old Growth front door and the panoramic view out the 15â triple sliding door as soon as you enter. The covered deck with a T&amp;G fir ceiling has been especially great this summer as Iâm spending more time at home because of the pandemic.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We designed our home with the Primary Suite and Laundry on the main level, which is a huge value add for Aging-in-Place and resale. And since it has a daylight basement, our son essentially gets his own floor. Itâs great for corralling friends and adds a buffer from video game noise traveling upstairs.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new finishes, upgrades, light and airy color palette, and high ceilings add beauty to my home from an aesthetic perspective, however, the favorite things about my new home are items that add comfort and save time: central air, a ton of storage, great work flow, functional design, and an irrigation system!Â Â </span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><h3><b>How has the design-build industry changed during COVID-19?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Mosaik, we have gotten busier if you can believe it. Since people are at home much more now, they have more time to âliveâ with their home: good, bad, and ugly. We receive a lot of calls from people who hate their kitchen even more because they are using it all of the time. I always say, âLife is too short to live with an ugly kitchen or (insert room here).â Also, since more people are working from home, thereâs an increased need to create space for a home office.</span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><h3><b>What should a homeowner consider before deciding to remodel?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most important things to ask yourself is, how long will I stay in my home and how much should I invest? I always ask this because even though itâs not the most exciting part of the remodeling process, itâs by far one of the most important considerations. Many of our homeowners consult a local Realtor for home values in their neighborhood.</span></p></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, we recently finished an extensive 3-story deck overhaul for our absolute favorite clients.Â  This is our 4th project together so there was a great level of trust built in regarding expectations, communication, and client tastes. Very few surprises.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deck is now an entertainers dream with a SONOS sound system, modern cable railing, cedar T&amp;G ceilings, 2 separate dining areas, an enlarged upper deck that takes in the incredible view, and a newly remodeled pool bath. We donât do a lot of exterior work, so it enabled me to push my comfort zone. It was a lot of fun too!</span></p></div>
